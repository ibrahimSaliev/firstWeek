   <h3><p>I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word</p>
<p>Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own</p></h3>
<hr>

<h3><p>I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes</p>
<p>Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"</p>
<hr>
</h3>
<h3><p>One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me</p>
<p>And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand</p>
<hr>
</h3>
<h3><p> hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing</p>
<p> my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field</p></h3><hr>
<h3><p>For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never</p>
<p> an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world</p></h3><hr>
<h3><p>It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in</p>
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
<p>people couldn't believe what I'd become</p></h3><hr>
<h3><p>Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate</p>
<p>Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?</p></h3><hr>
<h3><p>I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing</p>
<p>Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field</p></h3><hr>
<h3><p>For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word</p>
<P>But that was when I ruled the world</p></h3><hr>
